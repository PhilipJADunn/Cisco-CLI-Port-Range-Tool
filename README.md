# Cisco-CLI-Port-Range-Tool
A simple tool to open a range of ports via the command line interface for a Cisco 800 Series Router.

Opening a large range of ports on a router via the CLI can be quite time consuming, this tool can help you save time by simply inputting the protocol, where you want to route the traffic and the port range.

This will then loop through the port range and allow you to enter them into the CLI without having to change them one by one.

This is built with the assumption the technician knows how to configure the router correctly and also that the interface will be Dialer1.
